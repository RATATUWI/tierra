           La Tierra Nature Escape began as a home away from home for its proprietors. Upon realizing the beauty and healing
            power of the place, it was decided that the place would be opened to the public in order to create a space wherein
             anyone can experience La Tierraâ€™s magic for themselves. With the humdrum daily lives most people live, 
           La Tierra is the perfect place to get a reset, enjoy some relaxation, and obtain a well-deserved recharge.  </h4>
